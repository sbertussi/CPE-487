# Textbook Solutions
This folder contains my solutions to the exercises at the end of each chapter in *Free Range VHDL*.

Each solution includes the VHDL file that answers a question, a corresponding test bench (tb) file, and the output VCD file that was checked with GTKWave.  Each folder contains directions specific to running that chapter's solutions.

Note that the following chapters do not have any end of chapter exercises:
- Chapter 1
- Chapter 2
- Chapter 6
