# Labs

Due to the pandemic and limited access to FPGAs, the labs were completed as part of a group effort.  This folder contains the code run by Elizabeth Cone (GitHub: https://github.com/e-c-cone/CPE487) who had the FPGA for my group.

Original lab files for the course can be found in Prof. Lu's GitHub: https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd/tree/master/Nexys-A7
